### Civitates Hispaniae
Within the ERC-project "An Empire of 2000 Cities" I have written my doctoral thesis published by Routledge as [*Urbanism of Roman Spain and Portugal*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003022800/urbanisation-roman-spain-portugal-pieter-houten). In the upcoming months I will publish more webmaps showing the results of this work.<br>
The first map has been published. Check the description [here](https://github.com/PHAHouten/CivitatesHispaniae) or go directly to the [Juridical status map](https://phahouten.github.io/CivitatesHispaniae/#6/39.835/-0.284)


Newly published maps will be announced on my personal [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/HoutenPieter)
