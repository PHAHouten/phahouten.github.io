The focus of my research is on social processes such as urbanisation and Latinization (the spread of Latin) in the Roman west, with a specific focus on the Iberian Peninsula and the Magreb in Antiquity. Within the ANR/DFG-project [ATLAS](www.atlas-cities.com) I research the Late Antique cities of Southern Spain and Tunisia. For the ERC-project [LatinNow](www.latinnow.eu) I study the spread of Latin during the Imperial period, especially on those who learn to speak and write Latin as a second language next to the palaeohispanic languages. My PhD-research on urban settlement on the Iberian Peninsula during the Early Empire has been published as Urbanisation in Roman Spain and Portugal (Routledge 2021).
For my research I combine archaeological, epigraphic and historical sources to obtain a clearer picture of these and other social processes. Most of my work uses digital methods, mostly Geographic Information Systems to map and analyse the data. Through this use of GIS I have become interested in the spatiality of epigraphy.

This personal GitHub page is to open my data to a wider public as I am a firm believer in #OpenScience and #Openaccess.

### GIS for Classical Studies
In 2019 [Jan Schneider](https://github.com/Schneider-Jan) and I conceived the plan to create a workshop to teach QGIS to people studying antiquity. This workshop became an online course during the COVID19 pandemic and can be found here: [QGIS for Classical Studies](https://github.com/Toletum-Network/QGIS_Classical_Studies). Since then we have been invited to give the course several times and we have created some smaller bespoke workshops.

### Civitates Hispaniae
Within the ERC-project "An Empire of 2000 Cities" I have written my doctoral thesis published by Routledge as [*Urbanism of Roman Spain and Portugal*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003022800/urbanisation-roman-spain-portugal-pieter-houten). In the upcoming months I will publish more webmaps showing the results of this work.<br>
The first map has been published. Check the description [here](https://github.com/PHAHouten/CivitatesHispaniae) or go directly to the [Juridical status map](https://phahouten.github.io/CivitatesHispaniae/#6/39.835/-0.284)


Newly published maps will be announced on my personal [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/HoutenPieter)
